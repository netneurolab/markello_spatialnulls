## Overview of this walkthrough

This walkthrough is designed to accompany the manuscript "[Comparing spatial null models for brain maps](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.249797v1)" by Ross Markello and Bratislav Misic.
While we strove to be detailed in our manuscript, we acknowledge that working through code and data files (however well-documented) to reproduce results from other people can be...frustrating.
This walkthrough attempts to lay out the relevant steps required to install + set up your computing environment, how to get access to the (minimal) data required to run the code, and what commands + scripts you need to run to re-generate our results.
Of course, you'll need to refer to the actual code files in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/netneurolab/markello_spatialnulls) for this to all make sense, but hopefully it helps make this whole reproducibility process a bit less garish.

## Questions?

If anything in this walkthrough (or in our repository or our manuscript!) is confusing / unclear / whathaveyou, you can reach out by either (1) [opening an issue](https://github.com/netneurolab/markello_spatialnulls/issues) on our GitHub repository, or (2) [emailing Ross](mailto:ross.markello@mail.mcgill.ca).
